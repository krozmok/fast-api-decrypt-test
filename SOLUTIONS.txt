for me, the purpose of life is, at least partly, to have joy.
ruby inherited the perl philosophy of having more than one way      
to do the same thing. i inherited that philosophy from larry wall,  
who is my hero actually. i want to make ruby users free. i want to  
give them the freedom to choose. people are different. people choose
different criteria. but if there is a better way among many
alternatives, i want to encourage that way by making it comfortable.
so that's what i've tried to do.
i want to solve problems i meet in the daily life by using computers,
so i need to write programs. by using ruby, i want to concentrate the
things i do, not the magical rules of the language, like starting with
public void  something something something to say, "print hello world."
i just want to say, "print this!" i don't want all the surrounding
magic keywords. i just want to concentrate on the task. that's the basic
idea. so i have tried to make ruby code concise and succinct.
